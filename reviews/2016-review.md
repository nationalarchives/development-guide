# 2016 Development Guide and Peer Review

## Workshops

We held three workshops with developers to shape this review. This included:

### Purpose of the Development Guide / Peer Review

We identified five broad aims for the Development Guide / Peer Review:

* Supporting us in meeting requirements of the Government Service Design Manual, including
* Improving our productivity, including: 
    * Working smarter to avoid duplicated effort, ensure we are documenting our work properly and avoiding technical debt
    * Improving our estimates
* Supporting the wider team - our development approach should support the needs of our UX and visual design approaches
* Supporting developers' skills development

### Reviewing our processes

We then discussed our existing processes, including:

Area | Views/suggestions
--- | --- 
Exploration of new tools, processes etc. | About right - perhaps a bit fast. **Suggestion:** Could we use 10% to highlight what's new each weeek and decide whether it's worth reviewing?
Extent/quality of our documentation (README, commits, comments) | About right.
Testing our code | Broad range of views on this ranging from not enough to just right. **Suggestion:** Improve the quality of our testing
Quality of our code | Good. **Suggestion:** we could look to improve our consistency (coding standards)
Pace of development / Ability to adapt | Range of views from 'about right' to 'too fast' including recognition that we are very adaptable and capable of turning things in short time frames
Strength of our development guide | Broadly OK with a view that it is 'very useful as a self-check tool and as a peer review document. 
Extent to which we are following the development guide | Broadly OK but with room for improving our processes. One comment was 'Used regularly and followed as much as possible'.


### Where do we want to be: 

During one of the workshops team members were asked to identify what improvements to our development process they would like to see over the coming year. Here were the responses: 

* To make Unit Testing a core part of our approach
* Bring all QA processes into the Design Team 
* Raise our external profile (create a new Twitter presence, run workshops, hackdays and write blogs - maybe even start a podcast of our 10 percent sessions)
* Start packaging dependencies that are used across applications and stacks (i.e. PHP, .NET)
* Explore visual regression testing (and automating this)
* Explore service static assets from a CDN
* To have a development staging site that is separate from the content staging site
* Automatic deployment of code and content from staging to live
* Improve our working practices when working with .NET applications
* Componentise our design guide (with tests)
