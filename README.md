# Development guide and peer review

## Introduction

This repository outlines a development approach that will support us in delivering high quality, inclusive and maintainable digital services while achieving a good balance between innovation and effective use of our development capability. It is a living, open tool to which we should all contribute.

The [development guide and peer review](/peer-review-template.md) is presented as sequential checkpoints and can be used as a companion to the development process. Each section includes relatedÂ peer review checks along with:

 * A section for developer(s) comments.
 * A section for comments from the peer reviewer.
 * A section for comments from the product owner.

The nature of web projects and tasks will mean that some checks are not relevant to all projects or tasks. **It is therefore the responsibility of developers to**: 

1. Identify the checks relevant to the specific development activity and **ensure their development work meets all relevant checks**. 

2. Ensure all relevant **pre-release checks take place at a time that will allow for any necessary changes** before the product or service is made public. By following the progressive enhancement approach set out in this Development Guide, developers will have a good sense of the project 'health' at any given time, reducing the likelihood that substantial changes will be needed as development nears completion.

3. Where appropriate, discuss any lessons learned during a Design Team 10% meeting with a view to capturing insights that might benefit our approach to future projects.

## Conducting a peer review

The process for conducting a peer review is separated into [X] distinct steps: 

_To be agreed with the team:_

* _Coding standards, knowledge sharing (Pull requests etc.)_
* _User-focussed considerations (accessibility etc.)_
* _Product owner sign off_ 
* _What do we peer review, when and how_
