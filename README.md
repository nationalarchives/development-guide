# Development guide and peer review

## Introduction

This repository outlines a development approach that will support us in delivering high quality, inclusive and maintainable digital services while achieving a good balance between innovation and effective use of our development capability. This is presented as sequential checkpoints and can be used as a companion to the development process. 

It is a living, open tool to which we should all contribute in response to contributions, industry developments and lessons learned.

Each section within the development guide describes related [peer review checks](/peer-review-template.md), including:

 * A section for comments from the peer reviewer. 
 * A section for developer(s) comments.

The nature of web projects and tasks will mean that some checks are not relevant to all projects or tasks. **It is therefore the responsibility of developers to**: 

1. Identify the checks relevant to the specific development activity and ensure their development work meets all relevant checks. 

2. Ensure all relevant pre-release checks take place at a time that will allow for any necessary changes. By following the progressive enhancement approach set out in this Development Guide, developers will have a good sense of the project 'health' at any given time, reducing the likelihood that substantial changes will be needed as development nears completion.

A lessons learned form for each project that is to be completed during a Design Team meeting with a view to capturing insights that might benefit our approach to future projects.

## Conducting a peer review

To conduct a peer review follow these steps: 

* The peer reviewer shoud create a copy of the peer-review-template.md and add it to this repository with the name of the peer review being conducted. For example, a peer review of a meeting minutes template might be saved as meeting-minutes.md
* The peer reviewer should then populate the created file with the peer review comments and let the developer know when you've finished.
* The developer should then act on the comments and, where appropriate, provide further comments.
