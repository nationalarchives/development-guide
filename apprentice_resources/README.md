# Learning Resources for Software Developer apprentices

This document lists resources that will help Software Developer apprentices get to grips with key technologies they will be exposed to at The National Archives. It is a living resource - compiled by experienced developers - with the intention of directing apprentices to valuable learning materials that reflect industry best-practice. 

## HTML 

HTML is the fundamental technology to provide structure and meaning to content delivered to web users. Every HTML element has a purpose and the correct - or incorrect - usage of an element can have a significant impact on the user experience. 
 
 It is a simple language with which a lot can be achieved through declarative means. It is well worth the investment required in gaining a solid understanding of what can be achieved with HTML to avoid the common pitfall of reinventing HTML capabilities with complex CSS and/or imperative JavaScript.
 
 _Note: HTML should not be confused with HTML5 APIs which are better understood as interfaces accessible via JavaScript_
 
* The [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) provides a good introduction and concludes with a couple of assessment exercises that will help you test your understanding
* Both the [W3C HTML reference](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/) and [MDN HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) provide a means of checking aspects of specific tags, including:
    * The semantics of a specific element
    * What an element can be contained by
    * Attributes that can be applied to an element

### Progressive enhancement 

The National Archives Development Guide is based on the principles of [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement). Useful resources that will describe the purpose and benefits of progressive enhancement are: 
 
 * The book [Adaptive Web Design](https://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/) by Aaron Gustafson - the older [first edition](https://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/read/) is available to read for free online
 * The blog post [Why we use progressive enhancement to build GOV.UK](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/19/why-we-use-progressive-enhancement-to-build-gov-uk/) by the Lead Front End Developer at Government Digital Service (GDS)
  * Jeremy Keith's [Resilience](https://vimeo.com/166790296) presentation from Render Conference 2016
