## Git

When working with Git we:
 
* follow the branching methodology in use for the specific product. In some cases this will be [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), for others it might be [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or another approach.
* use [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to ensure all code has been reviewed before being merged

### Providing useful commit messages

A considered commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change and is therefore a vital aspect of good collaboration. A particularly useful resource for understanding this is provided in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) which outlines the [seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) of a great Git commit message as: 

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. how
