# Peer review checklist

This checklist represents the high level checks necessary to ensure that sites, applications and features have been: 

* **designed** in accordance with The National Archives' design patterns
* **developed** to meet the standards set out in the development guide
* **tested** for accessibility and compatibility with supported operating systems and browsers

If for any reason it has not been possible to meet any individual standard set out in the development guide the reason and justification should be recorded here.

## Checkpoint 1: Design

The reviewer is satisfied that:

* the site, application or feature follows the principles and patterns laid out in The National Archives' [Design guide](http://designguide.livelb.nationalarchives.gov.uk/)
* for standalone sites and applications, the design meets the standards required by The National Archives' web team.

### Comments from peer reviewer and developer(s)

## Checkpoint 2: Development

A pull request has been conducted before any code is merged to `develop` and the reviewer is satisfied that all development standards have been met. **Please include a link to the pull request in GitHub within the comments**

### Comments from peer reviewer and developer(s)

## Checkpoint 3: Testing

The developer and peer reviewer are confident that:

* The release version is WCAG 2.0 compliant at AA
* The resulting site, application or feature is compatible with supported operating systems and browsers

Any issues identified should be handled as part of the pull request process (which is linked to above). The only comment needed here is to indicate that the issues have been addressed.

## Lessons learned

Everything we build provides opportunities to for improvement to our processes and approach. By documenting the lessons learned and considering their implications for this development guide, we can understand the root cause of any problems as well as any opportunities for improvement.
Questions to consider

* What worked well either for this project or for the team?
* What didn't work well?
* What surprises did the team have to deal with?
* What would you do differently if given the chance to begin this project again

### Having considered these questions, what are the key lessons to take forward for future projects?
