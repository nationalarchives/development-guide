# Peer review checklist

This checklist represents all the checks necessary to ensure that all steps contained in the accompanying [development guide](development-guide.md) have been followed. Each section corresponds to a Checkpoint in the Development Guide and there are sections for comments from both the developer(s) and peer reviewer.

If for any reason it has not been possible to meet any individual standard set out in the development guide the reason and justification should be recorded here.
