# Peer review checklist

This checklist represents the high level checks necessary to ensure that sites, applications and features have been: 

* **designed** in accordance with The National Archives' design patterns
* **developed** to meet the standards set out in the development guide
* **tested** for accessibility and compatibility with supported operating systems and browsers

If for any reason it has not been possible to meet any individual standard set out in the development guide the reason and justification should be recorded here.
